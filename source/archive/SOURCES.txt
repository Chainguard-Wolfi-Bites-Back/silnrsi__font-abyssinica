SOURCES
Abyssinica SIL v1.900
========================

This file describes the source files included with the Abyssinica SIL font
family. This information should be distributed along with the Abyssinica SIL
fonts and any derivative works.

As a reminder: these source files are Copyright (c) As a reminder: these source
files are Copyright (c) 2000-2019, SIL International (http://scripts.sil.org/)
with Reserved Font Names "Abyssinica" and "SIL".
This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.

Note that the primary source files for the fonts are the fonts themselves. They
contain all the important data in the fonts and can be studied and modified
using open font tools such as FontForge and TTX (which can both export to
text-based formats). To make further development easier we provide some
additional files:

FontLab "*.vfb" file: The .vfb file is a FontLab source file and contains all the
glyph outline data for the Abyssinica SIL font. Please note that it is not
possible to generate a font from this files that is identical to the final
version, as some postprocessing is done on the font after generation from
FontLab. However, it would be possible to generate a usable font for standard
(no smarts) Ethiopic usage.

Anchor "*-anchors.xml" fils: This is the XML file containing data on anchors
(attachment points) used in creating composite glyphs and OpenType/Graphite
code. This anchor data is present in the .vfb files, but this is a separate,
non-proprietary, text-based source for that information.

OpenType "*-designsource.otf" files: These are CFF-flavored OpenType fonts 
containing PostScript-style outlines. These are not intended as installable fonts, 
and we do not support that use. They are provided as a non-proprietary 
source of PostScript-style bézier outlines and can be opened by many font 
design programs, including FontForge.

VOLT code: The code used to insert OpenType tables into the font is included in
a VOLT font format. See the README.txt file in the VOLT folder for details.

Graphite code: See the README.txt file in the graphite folder for details.
