DOCUMENTATION
Abyssinica SIL v2.100
========================

The documentation for this project is listed in index.html.

There are also PDF versions in the `pdf` folder.

These are produced from markdown sources (in `source`) using pandoc,
weasyprint, and custom python scripts. See the `makedocs` shell script
in the main project folder.

Old documentation that will be removed:

AbyssinicaSILTypeSample.doc/pdf - illustrates the character set in Abyssinica SIL.
AbyssinicaSILFontFeatures.odt/pdf - documents the OpenType and Graphite
     features in the font. It serves to illustrate the use of Graphite features
     in LibreOffice 3.4+.
